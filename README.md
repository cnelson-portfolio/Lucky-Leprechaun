# Lucky Leprechaun
Wanted to build mobile apps without having to deploy through app stores. This simple game allowed me to test PWA rollouts: Github Pages > HTTPS:// > Add to Home Screen > Install directly on mobile devices.

Once installed, will work in Offline/Airplane mode.

This game focuses on using tilt (along the gamma axis/y-axis) to control movement of game element.

Enjoy!
